First attempt at making any form of web application. The goal is to make a MMO RTS game with a purely HTML5 / CSS / JS front-end with a REST API backend. Multiple instances of the game will run at a time, and each instance will run for a limited time. The user will be placed into a random city when joining where a city is a construct that acts like a guild or an alliance. Each city will have a government body made up of residents of the city, and major city actions will run through a voting system with input by the city residents. These actions will include tax rates, building upgrades, city vs city actions, etc. Each city will be one of three major classes: attack, defence, and trade. Trade cities will have high trade benefits (lower item costs and faster trades), but have weaker defence. Attack cities will have an advantage in battle, but have a lower trade bonus. Defense cities have a higher defence bonus, and a lower attack bonus. There will be several major player classes, and players can unlock a higher level of player class at specific level intervals.
